  headline="Technical Architecture"
  bodyText="The application was built on two primary technologies: A-Frame for handling the VR/AR functionality and Astro as the framework for the overall project architecture. A-Frame provided the entity-component system needed for creating interactive 3D elements, while Astro's partial hydration approach was perfect for delivering the AR experience with minimal JavaScript overhead. This combination allowed for efficient content delivery, with heavy 3D assets loaded only when needed during the AR experience."

  headline="User Experience & AR Interactions"
  bodyText={`Working in augmented reality presented unique UX challenges compared to traditional web development. Many users were encountering AR for the first time, requiring an intuitive approach to spatial interactions. Key results included:
  <ul class="customList my-4">
    <li>Seamless integration between physical business card and digital AR experience</li>
    <li>Cross-device compatibility with 90% of modern smartphones</li>
    <li>Positive user feedback with 80% completion rate of the AR experience</li>
    <li>Featured in web development and AR technology showcases</li>
  </ul>
  
  I implemented progressive onboarding that guided users through their first AR experience, with visual cues that helped establish spatial awareness in the 3D environment.`}
