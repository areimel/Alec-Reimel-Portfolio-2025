  headline="Centralized AI Prompt Management"
  bodyText="This project provides a simple, self-hostable directory for managing AI prompts within an organization or team. Instead of prompts scattered across documents or messages, this tool offers a central, searchable library. Users can easily browse, find relevant prompts, and copy them for use."

  headline="Built with Astro & Tailwind"
  bodyText="The directory is built using Astro, chosen for its focus on performance and content-driven websites. It allows for a fast user experience with minimal JavaScript by default. Styling is handled by Tailwind CSS for rapid UI development, and prompt content is managed using Astro's Content Collections feature with Markdown/MDX files, making it easy for anyone comfortable with Markdown to add or edit prompts."

  headline="Key Features & Templating"
  bodyText={`The core functionality includes a directory-style landing page for browsing prompts and individual pages for detailed views. A key recent addition is a simple fill-in-the-blanks templating system. This allows users to define variables within a prompt and then easily fill in those values directly on the web page before copying the finalized prompt, streamlining the customization process.`}

  headline="A 'Party Favor' Project"
  bodyText='This AI Prompt Directory is part of a series I call "party favor" projects. The idea is to create genuinely useful, standalone tools that can be freely given away. They serve as a goodwill gesture, a practical utility for others, and a way to showcase specific development skills (like working with Astro and content-heavy sites) in a tangible, shareable format.'
